Adds a second stock location field to WooCommerce products and manages pricing and stock levels automatically.

== Description ==
This plugin lets you track inventory in a secondary location for every WooCommerce product. Each item also gets an optional price that is used once the primary location runs out of stock. Stock quantities and status are calculated based on the combined total and orders automatically reduce quantities in both locations. The plugin also ships with an update checker that can pull new versions from GitHub.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `gn-additional-stock-location` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin from **Plugins** in the WordPress admin.
3. Edit a product to enter values for **2nd Stock Location** and **2nd Location Price**. Variations have their own fields as well.
